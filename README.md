# Global Health Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard exploring global health trends, life expectancy, population and BMI across different countries and continents. 

## Welcome to my Global Health Dashboard project! 🌍📊  
As part of my data bootcamp I analysed global health trends using the Gapminder Health dataset to uncover patterns in life expectancy, population and health metrics across countries and continents.
## Project Focus
I was working on behalf of the Global Health Organisation as a data analyst and the team needs to quickly understand key health trends and disparities across different countries and continents focusing on life expectancy and other health metrics over time.
## Visualisations
### Life Expectancy by Continent in the most recent year
This bar chart shows the average life expectancy across each continent using the most recent year available in the dataset. It provides an immediate view of regional health differences highlighting which continents experience the highest life expectancy and which regions still face significant challenges and room for improvement.

### Life Expectancy Trend Over Time in the Top five Countries
This line chart tracks how life expectancy has changed over time for the top five countries with the highest overall life expectancy.By focusing on the countries with the highest life expectancy this visual highlights how global health has improved over time. It clearly shows the differences in progress between nations and reveals which countries consistently maintain the longest lifespans. Overall it provides a clear view of how health outcomes have evolved across decades.

### Health Metric Comparison Life Expectancy vs BMI
This scatter plot explores the relationship between life expectancy and BMI across countries with each point coloured by continent. It provides a clear visual comparison of how different regions position themselves in terms of overall health helping to identify patterns and potential correlations between BMI levels and longevity of the life expectancy.

### Dashboard Overview
This section brings together all the individual visualisations into a single interactive dashboard. It provides a unified view of global health trends that will allow any users to explore insights from multiple angles in one place.

# 🔍 Analysis & Key Findings
Looking at the dashboard you can see some clear differences in health outcomes around the world. Europe and Oceania generally have the highest life expectancy while Africa is still falling behind which highlights ongoing challenges with healthcare access and development. Countries like Japan, Switzerland and Australia show steady improvements over time which reflects strong healthcare systems and better living conditions.
Most countries have a fairly even gender balance although women tend to live longer. The dashboard also shows a link between BMI and life expectancy. In countries with higher BMI levels often wealthier nations generally live longer but only up to a certain point.
Overall these visuals make global health patterns easier to understand and highlight where progress has been made and where challenges remain.

# 🏥 Reflection on how the NHS could utilise this to improve health in the UK
The NHS could use a dashboard like this to see how the UK compares with other developed countries. Tracking life expectancy alongside BMI and other health metrics could help spot potential health risks early such as rising obesity related conditions.
However it could also help support the NHS and both the UK by allowing better planning and strategy but having more informed police decisions but importantly this will allow the NHS to allocate resources more methodically to improve public health in the UK
This kind of interactive visualisation turns data into insights that can help make smarter and better decisions which is exactly what health organisations need.

## Dataset
